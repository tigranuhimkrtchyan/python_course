"""
Create a class named User and create a way to check the number of users (number of instances) that were created,
so that the value can be accessed as a class attribute.
Examples
u1 = User("johnsmith10")
User.user_count ➞ 1
u2 = User("marysue1989")
User.user_count ➞ 2
u3 = User("milan_rodrick")
User.user_count ➞ 3
Make sure that the usernames are accessible via the instance attribute username.
u1.username ➞ "johnsmith10"
u2.username ➞ "marysue1989"
u3.username ➞ "milan_rodrick"
Notes
Feel free to check out the resources provided in the Resources tab for some helpful information on Python 
classes!
