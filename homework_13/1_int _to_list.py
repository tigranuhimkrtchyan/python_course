"""
In abstract set theory, a construction due to von Neumann represents
 the natural numbers by sets, as follows:
    0 = [ ] is the empty set
    1 = 0 ∪ [ 0 ] = [ 0 ] = [ [ ] ]
    2 = 1 ∪ [ 1 ] = [ 0, 1 ] = [ [ ], [ [ ] ] ]
    n = n−1 ∪ [ n−1 ] = ...
Write a function that receives an integer n and produces the represen-
ting set.
Examples
rep_set(0) ➞ []
rep_set(1) ➞ [[]]
rep_set(2) ➞ [[], [[]]]
rep_set(3) ➞ [[], [[]], [[], [[ ]]]]
Notes
    Make sure to use list brackets [,].
    Technically we should use set brackets {,} instead, but Python 
    doesn't approve.
    A neat feature of this representation is that n < m precisely if
     the set representing n is contained in the set representing m.
